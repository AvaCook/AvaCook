## 📌 Featured Projects

### Course Registration Management System
Full-stack web application built with Java, JSP, Servlets, and MySQL following the MVC architecture. Implemented enrollment validation, prerequisite checks, and capacity constraints, and deployed using Tomcat and Maven with secure data handling.

### Faculty Research Website
Collaboratively developed and deployed a research platform for faculty and student work. Implemented a responsive frontend with Bootstrap and migrated the backend from Node.js/MongoDB to PHP/MySQL due to hosting constraints.

### Machine Learning Classification – Iris Dataset
Implemented and evaluated supervised learning models (KNN, SVM) using scikit-learn. Performed data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation, achieving high classification accuracy and documenting experimental results.

## 🤖 AI & Data Interests

I use AI and machine learning as tools to support analysis, experimentation, and development — not as a replacement for understanding the problem. I’m especially interested in responsible AI use, model evaluation, and human-in-the-loop systems.
